        <p> Jenny Odell’s How To Internet provides a multidimensional perspective into the world wide web, and the variety contents that constitute it. As the author explains, the superhighway that is the internet is kind of a loop-feedback system that is based on your online activity. Navigating the many forms of connectivity and communication that exist within the diversity of websites that exist on the web, and doing it right, requires a plethora of “imagination, caution, and fortitude” - especially with reimagined forms of internet. Focusing from internet to website, Laurel Swulst, in her article, unpacks a website, underlining its fundamental contents, following by stating that there are endless possibilities for a website, as it is subject and object simultaneously. The web is “interconnected web of individual nodes breathing life into a vast network,” as through interactive and creative design artists make their own works as well as architect their worlds, which inform one another. The author goes through the many forms a website can assume - from a shelf to a garden - concluding that a website is simply what you make it. Molly Soda’s website is a perfect example of this conclusion that a website can simply look like anything. It has a completely unique aesthetic, looking like a grimey, messy, scrollable early 2000’s Windows desktop that is a perfect reflection of Molly Soda’s visual identity and artistry, demonstrating just one of the millions of forms a website can truly assume.
