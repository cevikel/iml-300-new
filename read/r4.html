        <h1> Reading 4 </h1><p>What “Rich User Experience, UX, Desktopization of War” highlights is the growing legitimization and development of user experience, becoming a substitute for the word interface. The reason why “experience” is important is to hide the customizability and programmability of a system, and to reduce the amount the users interact with the said system - like video backgrounds, Siri, and the undo button. This pushes users through audio visual and aesthetic channels to believe that the system doesn’t exist, creating user illusion. Experience only matters when it feels natural, and “natural” conveniently meets the exact needs of the customer, widening the gap between the user and their computer. <br><br>

"Black Gooey Universe" considers a graphical user interface, GUI, or “gooey,” the Cis white-centric, out of touch and compressed growth of Silicon Valley as well as startup culture dictated creative direction of developers to a narrative of whiteness. White space in most universally applied devices and platforms (which stem from Silicon Valley) is now the default expectation and understanding, familiarizing the user with a comfortable but corporate neutrality. But what about the black screen that GUI stemmed from, in the oldest versions of the computer? Black interface can allow everything and nothingness at once, becoming a means of “slowness, refusal, thought, complexity, critique, softness, loudness, transparency, uselessness, and brokenness.”<br><br>

Now that Dark Mode is a widespread option on devices and platforms, perhaps we can reconsider black interfaces and what truly feels “natural” in UX.</p>
   
    <h1> Discussion Questions </h1>
    
    <p> 


 1.Is widening the gap between computer and user necessarily the best thing for UX? <br>
 2.Do users demand more customizable options or want to surrender to the user illusion? <br>
 3.How would blackness in GUI be different if Silicon Valley developed and designed in a more inclusive manner?
