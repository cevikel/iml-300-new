        <h1> Reading 3 </h1><p>The lecture revolved around the discussion of the internet, by firstly covering the history, and the role gender played in the innovation of technology and the web. During the WW2 era, female inventors had a colossal and crucial role in creating the first commercial computer; prior to male dominance on the computer science industry, most programmers were women, which is highlighted by a 1967’ article from Cosmopolitan, named “Computer Girls.” Moreover, surprisingly, the net was designed under military agency for defense, command and control during the war, against nuclear attacks. Nevertheless, ever since the creation of the first website 20 years ago, there are now 1 billion websites, constituting the internet. But what exactly is it? Most people regard the web as an omnipresent, trusty cloud. However, the internet is constituted of individual computers in connection with one another, through hosts and clients, traveling also via a high-speed, intercontinental, subterranean cable system dating back to 200 years ago. Essentially, though, the Internet is what we make it. Now more than ever, we need individuals to guide the future of websites, and need to shift power from massive corporations like Google and Facebook back to the people.
